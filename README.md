# furnitureapp

Hey guys, I created this app for people with beginner Flutter knowledge to have an idea about the usage of different widgets. Also, I used custom tab indicator, you can observe the code to understand how Flutter gives you access to manipulate every pixel of the screen. I used flutter_screenutil for responsive UI. It is a very handy library for making apps responsive.


These screens were designed by my good designer friend Atiq. Here's the link:
